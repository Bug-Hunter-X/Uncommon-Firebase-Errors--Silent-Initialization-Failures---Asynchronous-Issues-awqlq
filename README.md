# Uncommon Firebase Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon yet crucial error scenarios in Firebase:

1. **Silent Initialization Failure:** Incorrect configuration can lead to the Firebase SDK failing to initialize without throwing explicit errors.
2. **Asynchronous Operation Handling:** Improper handling of asynchronous Firebase methods can result in race conditions and unexpected behavior.

The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases these issues, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides corrected implementations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project.  Ensure that you replace the placeholder configuration in `firebaseBug.js` with your actual Firebase project details.
4. Run `node firebaseBug.js` to observe the error scenarios.
5. Then, run `node firebaseBugSolution.js` to see the corrected code and its proper functioning.
