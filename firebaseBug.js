The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the provided configuration is incorrect or missing.  For instance, if the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc., are not correctly set in your `firebase.json` or Firebase console, initialization could fail, resulting in silent errors or unexpected behavior.  Another common issue is improper use of asynchronous operations.  Callbacks or Promises returned by Firebase methods may not be handled correctly, leading to race conditions or unhandled exceptions.
